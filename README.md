EC500: Building Software

Welcome to Boris Huang's EC500: Building Softwares, taught by Professor Osama Alshaykh from Boston University ECE department. Within this repository, you are able to find the source code for each assignment of this course. 

## Class Outline:
EC500 is a project-based graduate level course in Boston University ECE department. Professor Osama organized the course in a way that students are able to gain exposure to the main components of building software from each stages. The class consists of one API project, one Database project as well as a final project. 

### API Project:
The purpose of this API project is to familiarize students with the concept of API, Implementation of different APIs, as well as the pipelining of several APIs working as a whole.

### Assignment Expectations:
Download pictures from a twitter account to our local environment
Use Google Vision API to generate the labels for each images
Generate a video as output and dispaly labels in whatever way you wise.

#### Implementation:
The way I approach this project is to generate pictures using Twitter API and for each image, I generate labels and superimpose them on each image. Later, I use Ffmpeg to generate a video with pictures with descriptions. In the future, I wish I can change the fontsize of the labels within the video.

#### Database Project:
The purpose of this database project is to familiarize students with the concepts of Mongo database, Implementation of Mongo Database, MySQL as well as generating useful data according to users' requests.


### Final Project:
The purpose of the final project is to grant students an opportunity to build software application using Python (Or whatever language that fits the situation) with the implementation of API, Database as well as software component organization. The final project spans through the entire semester with Sprint 1-4 and several presentations and demos in front of the class. CE students not only learn to cooperate as a team, but also learn to improve technical public speaking skills through Demos/Presentation.
