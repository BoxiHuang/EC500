# EC500

Hello World! Thank you for coming to Boris Huang's Github. I am currently a junior in Boston University studying Computer Engineering.
So I enrolled in this class called EC500: Building Softwares 

My first project is to learn how to use Twitter API and Google Vision API to do some data sorting, 
eventually generate a video!

Assignment Expectations:

1. Download pictures from a twitter account to our local environment and 
2. Use Google Vision API to generate the labels for each images
3. Generate a video as output and dispaly labels in whatever way you wise.

The way I approach this project is to generate pictures using Twitter API and for each image, I generate labels and superimpose them on each image. 
Later, I use Ffmpeg to generate a video with pictures with descriptions.
In the future, I wish i can change the fontsize of the labels and also display labels on the terminal as well.

Thank you for coming here and Please let me know if i have any issue or rooms to inmprove.
