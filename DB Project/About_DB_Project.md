EC500 Database Project:

The purpose behind this database project is to allow students to learn and to familiarize themselves with Database implementation. Through this database project, students will have a good grip on how to apply various databases within App building process. Professor Osama splits this project for three phases, as it is specified in the following:

Phase 1: Learn mongdb --> Go through Mongo DB tutorial Install all Pyhton related SW and drivers Write a python program to import the airport location data Demonstrate the following functions Read data Update data Search and find data

Phase 2: Design DB for project 1

Go back to Project 1: 
Twitter+FFMPEG+Google Vision Design database to implement persistent user stories 
Detail information of every transaction the user may run using your system 
Retrieve information about twitter handles in your system, 
Description of the media they have 
Description of videos generated 
Collective statistics about overall usage of the system. (For example Number of images per feed)
Most popular descriptors Relationship between Google Trending terms and Twitter feeds

Phase 3: Test properties of your design

Develop scripts to run your new system (combined project 1 + Database project) with at least 20 twitter handles for at least 3 consecutive days (I donâ€™t want you to go over your free Google Vision API limits) You can use most popular Twitter users Use your module to provide daily stats about overall trending topics and usage
